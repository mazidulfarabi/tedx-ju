        "Imagine a fish judging a bird for flying. Sounds silly, right? But that's exactly what we do when we try to define 'normal.' We build boxes which are perfectly shaped, labeled, painted with rules, and then expect everyone to fit inside. Too quiet? Weird. Too loud? Problem. Too different? Fix it.",
        "But here's the thing, 'normal' isn't the truth, it's a habit. A pattern which has been passed down. Most of the time, the people who sit in big chairs, or write the history books decide what's normal. And we just follow along, scared to ask, 'Why?'",
        "But what if 'normal' is just the most popular opinion, not the most correct one? Every rebel, artist, misfit, and thinker who ever broke the pattern started with this one brave thought, 'What if the rule is wrong?'",
        "So maybe it's time we stop trying to fit in and start asking better questions. Because the moment we challenge 'normal,' we open the door to something much more powerful."

        "During the July protests in Bangladesh, the streets turned into canvases. Students painted bold graffiti on walls, flyovers, roads and buses. Their messages were loud and clear: 'Roktakto July', 'Killer Hasina', 'Awaj Uda', 'Pani Lagbe? Pani?' These weren't art for galleries. These were anger. These were grief. This was the truth.",
        "In a world where art often feels like soft background music, these graffiti screamed. They didn't care about symmetry or aesthetics. They were raw. Messy. Brave. And most importantly, real.",
        "So yes, art is still revolutionary. It just looks different now. Maybe it's not always in museums, but it's there. In broken walls. In bold words. In messy strokes that carry powerful truths.",
        "Art doesn't just decorate. It defends, it resists, and sometimes it even helps bring change. When voices are silenced, art shouts. And in that July heat, it shouted loud enough to shake a regime."

        "1. Own Your Time: Balance is a myth without boundaries. Use planners, apps, or plain old sticky notesâ€“whatever helps you take control of your day before it takes control of you.",
        "2. Build Your Circle: Surround yourself with people who challenge, inspire, and support you. Clubs, group projects, and random dorm conversations are where the real learning begins.",
        "3. Say Yes (and No): Opportunities are everywhere, but not all of them are yours to take. Say yes to growth, no to burnout, and always check in with what actually fuels you.",
        "Thriving on campus isn't about doing everything. It's about doing what matters, with purpose."

        "Every journey starts with a question. Ours was simple: 'Why not JU?' Curiosity sparked it all. TEDx was everywhere but never in JU. So we asked the obvious: What's stopping us?",
        "Determined to build, not wait, instead of waiting for someone else to bring it, we decided to be the ones to do it. Late-night Google dives and endless research followed. From 'how to get a TEDx license' to figuring out TED rules, we dove into red dots.",
        "The license hustle began. We crafted our story, our why, and applied for the TEDx license, knowing this was just the beginning. TEDxJU got licensed - that red stamp wasn't just approval. It was liftoff.",
        "Recruitment went LIVE. We needed a team bold enough to believe. So we called out and change-makers answered. From the first general meeting in Zoom rooms to brainstorming boards, the TEDxJU team came together. Our official page journey began - TEDxJU finally had a voice and we were ready to speak and listen to YOU.",
        "This is our 'before.' What's coming next? You'll have to stay tuned."
